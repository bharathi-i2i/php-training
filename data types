PHP Data Types

Variables can store data of different types, and different data types can do different things.

PHP supports the following data types:
1. String
2. Integer
3. Float (floating point numbers - also called double)
4. Boolean
5. Array
6. Object
7. NULL
8. Resource

PHP String
 - A string is a sequence of characters, like "Hello world!".
 - A string can be any text inside quotes. You can use single or double quotes:

PHP Integer
An integer data type is a non-decimal number between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647.
Rules for integers:
 - An integer must have at least one digit
 - An integer must not have a decimal point
 - An integer can be either positive or negative
 - Integers can be specified in: decimal (base 10), hexadecimal (base 16), octal (base 8), or binary (base 2) notation

PHP Float
 - A float (floating point number) is a number with a decimal point or a number in exponential form.

PHP Boolean
 - A Boolean represents two possible states: TRUE or FALSE.

PHP Array
 - An array stores multiple values in one single variable.

PHP Object
 - An object is a data type which stores data and information on how to process that data.
 - In PHP, an object must be explicitly declared.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<?php
class Car {
    function Car() {
        $this->model = "VW";
    }
}
// create an object
$herbie = new Car();

// show object properties
echo $herbie->model;
?>

</body>
</html>
