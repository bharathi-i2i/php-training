Constants are like variables except that once they are defined they cannot be changed or undefined.

PHP Constants - 

 - A constant is an identifier (name) for a simple value. The value cannot be changed during the script.

 - A valid constant name starts with a letter or underscore (no $ sign before the constant name).

Note: Unlike variables, constants are automatically global across the entire script.


Create a PHP Constant
 - To create a constant, use the define() function.


		Syntax - 

		define(name, value, case-insensitive)

		Parameters:

		name: Specifies the name of the constant
		value: Specifies the value of the constant
		case-insensitive: Specifies whether the constant name should be case-insensitive. Default is false


		<!DOCTYPE html>
		<html>
		<body>

		<?php
		// case-insensitive constant name
		define("GREETING", "Welcome to W3Schools.com!", true);
		echo greeting;
		?> 

		</body>
		</html>


PHP Constant Arrays - 
		In PHP7, you can create an Array constant using the define() function.
		<!DOCTYPE html>
		<html>
		<body>

		<?php
		define("cars", [
		    "Alfa Romeo",
		    "BMW",
		    "Toyota"
		]);
		echo cars[0];
		?> 

		</body>
		</html>


Constants are Global
		Constants are automatically global and can be used across the entire script.
