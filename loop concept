In PHP, we have the following loop types:

	1. while - loops through a block of code as long as the specified condition is true
	2. do...while - loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop as long as the specified condition is true
	3. for - loops through a block of code a specified number of times
	4. foreach - loops through a block of code for each element in an array


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<?php
$age = array("Peter"=>"35", "Ben"=>"37", "Joe"=>"43");

foreach($age as $x => $val) {
  echo "$x = $val<br>";
}
?>

</body>
</html>
